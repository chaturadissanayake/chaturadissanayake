# Chatura Dissanayake Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Chatura Dissanayake, a visual communicator and data storyteller specialising in transforming complex data into clear, compelling visual narratives. The site showcases skills, projects, visualisations, a career timeline, and contact information. It features a modern, responsive design with dark/light theme toggling, smooth animations, and interactive elements such as a visualisation carousel and an accordion.

The website is built as a static single-page application (SPA-like) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external frameworks or dependencies.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly with adaptive layouts for desktops, tablets, and phones.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes, with preferences saved in local storage.
- **Smooth Scrolling & Navigation**: Anchor links with offset for fixed header, active link highlighting via Intersection Observer.
- **Visualisation Carousel**: Interactive carousel for showcasing data visualisations, with lightbox modal for enlarged views.
- **Capabilities Accordion**: Expandable sections with animated skill bars.
- **Process Flow**: Visual representation of the data storytelling process.
- **Work Showcase**: Grid of project cards with hover effects.
- **Career Timeline**: Vertical timeline of professional experience.
- **FAQ Section**: Accordion-style frequently asked questions.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with Formspree for lead capture (configure your own endpoint).
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Appears on scroll for easy navigation.
- **Animations**: Fade-in sections on scroll, gradient background animation in hero.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus states, and semantic HTML.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design (using CSS variables, grid, flexbox, and media queries).

- **Fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts.
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons (embedded as SVGs).

No build tools or dependencies are required—it's a pure static site.
